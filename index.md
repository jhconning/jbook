# A Jupyter Book demo site

The Jupyter Book Project is an open-source project that enables users to create, publish, and share interactive and executable documents, such as books, reports, and course materials, using Jupyter Notebooks and other markup languages.

- Clone this repository to get started with your own Jupyter Book.
- Add jupyter notebooks and/or markdown content, and list that content in the `_toc.yml` file.
- Build your book locally using `jupyter-book build .`
- If github actions are [setup correctly](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/publish/gh-pages.html) in your github repo, your book should be automatically built and deployed to github pages on the next `git push` (see .github\workflows\build.yml)
- More documentation at: https://jupyterbook.org/
